# PISA Reading Performance Score: The Case for Indonesia
This repository aims to visualize Indonesia's position in terms of PISA reading performance score compared to Vietnam and OECD Countries.
World Bank's Indonesia Economic Quarterly Report (June 2018 edition) uses the reading score to proxy "functional literacy", which is further defined as the ability to not only read a text, but also understand and  answer questions related to it. Building off of the result of the analysis, we will be able to reflect on the way forward to close the gaps in education quality.

The dataset that I used for analysis are available in the "dataset" folder. They were all retrieved from https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/, in which they are already in the form of aggregated % share of the population by level and population. In case you are interested to crunch the raw data instead of the already-aggregated data, you could go to http://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2015database/ and continue from there.
